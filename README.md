# Ignite
>The Ignite Framework is the first attempt in building a sturdy foundation for ViUR products and Mausbrand projects.<br>This CSS toolkit is the very core of ViUR Ignite. It is built upon the principles of many CSS guides and frameworks.

For a detailed introduction and examples have a look at [http://ignite.viur.is](http://ignite.viur.is).
