# Ignite
> ViUR Ignite is a sizzling PostCSS boilerplate  

Our goal is to create a boilerplate that is sturdy and scalable 
yet lightweight and adaptable to our different customer projects.
Our approach to CSS is influenced by many modern CSS principles: object oriented, functional and structured.
It uses the power of PostCSS. 

For a detailed introduction and examples have a look at [ignite.viur.dev](https://ignite.viur.dev).

## What is this framework for?
* Ignite is a development toolkit for sturdy HTML and CSS
* It is a lightweight collection of helpful CSS 
* It is responsive and adaptable
* It is built with PostCSS
* It is a solid foundation for [Shoelace](https://github.com/viur-framework/vi-shoelace) and [VUEJS](https://github.com/viur-framework/vi-vue-components)

## Foundation
* _basic.css_ – styling of all application basics (body, fonts, headlines, lists etc.).
* _color.css_ – is a collection of color tables.
* _config.css_ – stores all default variables and constants.
* _mediaqueries.css_ – is a really simple solution for media queries.
* _reset.css_ – resets all browsers to the same base state.

## Themes
* _dark.css_ - is a starting point for a dark theme
* _light.css_ - is a starting point for a light theme

## Utilities
* _shoelace.css_ – the ignite shoelace adapter (ISA)
* _utilities.css_ – useful helpers
