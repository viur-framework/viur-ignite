// This is the master file.
// It imports all less files in their intended order for easy mass-inclusion.

// !!! Please use Ignite as a library and do not customize this file or any import.
// All generic elements are mixins with parentheses — they do not show up in your CSS output unless you use them.

@import 'foundation/appconf'; // stores all default variables and constants.
@import 'mixins/zindex'; // organizes and unifies `zindex` across the whole application.
@import 'foundation/shoelace'; // the viur shoelace adapter™ (ViSA)
