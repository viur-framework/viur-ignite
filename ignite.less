// This is the master file.
// It imports all less files in their intended order for easy mass-inclusion.

// !!! Please use Ignite as a library and do not customize this file or any import.
// All generic elements are mixins with parentheses — they do not show up in your CSS output unless you use them.

@import "foundation/_foundation"; // Fundamental parts: reset, positioning, type and utilities
@import "generic/_generic"; // Generic elements: buttons, forms and messages
@import "mixins/_mixins"; // Mixins: small, helpful tools
