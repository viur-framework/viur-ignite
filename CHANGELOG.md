After more than a year of development Ignite 3.0.0 now serves as a less foundation library.

### Removed
- grid.less has been removed, please use display: grid;

## [2.0.0] - 2016-12-19

In this major release ViUR Ignite CSS starts using the mobile first paradigm.

This means some huge changes to the way media queries are handled.
With 2.0.0 just use classes with .mq- prefix.
They are stored within mediaqueries.less and can be stacked (min + max + orientation).
The gulp task merges all media queries to the end of the compiled css file.

Moreover flex layout is no longer the exception but the norm.
